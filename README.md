# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This repository contains a project focused on predicting breast cancer diagnoses using machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the evaluation of multiple classifiers.

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on various features such as radius, texture, smoothness, and more from the dataset. The goal is to apply classification techniques to healthcare data and evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms in medical diagnostics.
## Model Implementation: 
Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier, for the binary classification of breast cancer tumors.
## Model Evaluation: 
Utilized performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance and identify the best-performing algorithm.
